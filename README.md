## Working with WP Rig
WP Rig can be used in any development environment. It does not require any specific platform or server setup. It also does not have an opinion about what local or virtual server solution the developer uses.

Before first run, visit the [BrowserSync wiki page](https://github.com/wprig/wprig/wiki/BrowserSync).


### Browser Support
As WP Rig processes CSS and JavaScript it will support the browsers listed in `.browserslistrc`. Note that WP Rig will **not** add polyfills for missing browser support. WP Rig **will** add CSS prefixes and transpile JavaScript.
